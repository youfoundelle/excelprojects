# excelprojects

Welcome to **ExcelProjects** — a curated collection of hands-on data analysis and visualization projects crafted in Microsoft Excel.

Behind every spreadsheet lies a story: a challenge solved, a question answered, or a business insight uncovered. This repository is my personal workspace where I transform raw data into clear, actionable narratives using formulas, pivot tables, and dynamic dashboards.

##  Why Excel?
Excel is more than just a tool—it's the foundation of data literacy. Through these projects, I demonstrate how powerful insights can emerge from seemingly simple grids of rows and columns. Each file is a step forward in my journey to mastering data analysis and reporting.

##  What You'll Find Here:
- Interactive dashboards that tell the story behind sales, customer behavior, and performance metrics
- Data cleaning and transformation exercises that highlight best practices
- Visual reports designed to communicate insights with clarity and impact
- Thoughtful documentation to guide you through my process and learnings

##  About Me
I go by the pseudonym adwoa.io, and this repository reflects my passion for data, curiosity, and commitment to continuous learning. Whether you’re a fellow data enthusiast, a recruiter, or just curious, I invite you to explore, learn, and connect.

Let’s turn data into decisions—one Excel project at a time.
